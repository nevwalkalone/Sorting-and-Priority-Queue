# Sorting Algorithms and Priority Queue Implementation

This project was completed for the Data Structures course of the [Department of Computer Science of the Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/el/cs), during the Fall semester of 2019-2020. 

The goal of this assignment was to get acquainted with **sorting algorithms and priority queues**. More specifically, this project addresses issues encountered in optimization problems regarding the allocation of memory resources for storing large volumes of data.
